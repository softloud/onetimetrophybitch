Authorship is alphabetical and equal in mathematics. Brian and Jane did a great deal of work on the final paper. But in my thesis, the proofs were all (but two small introductory proofs Brian wrote for completeness) my own.

Instead, there is the Turing award, the Fields medal, and the Abel prize. Each year the Heidelberg Laureate Forum Foundation gathers these laureates of mathematics and computing, along with two hundred talented early-career researchers, and science writers, for a week of lectures, workshops, and events designed to foster conversation and ideas.\nIt was a gift to present at the opening ceremony and have that introduction; I wasn’t in want of conversation for the entire event. I got to meet so many interesting people.\nSlides for the presentation can be found here.\ncode like a girl tour\ncheck out twitter reel from the tour\nand the event\n\nuseR! workshop\n\n\nmathbassador gray\n\n\n\n\n\nDavey, Brian A., Charles T.

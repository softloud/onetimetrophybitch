# Define $\leqslant$


Let $P$ be a set.

An *order* on $P$ is a binary relation $\leqslant$ on $P$ such that,

***

for all $x, y, z$ in $P$, we have

- $x \leqslant x$;
- $x \leqslant y$ and $y \leqslant x$ imply $x = y$;
- $x \leqslant y$ and $y \leqslant z$ imply $x \leqslant z$.

***

We then say $\leqslant$ is *reflexive*, *antisymmetric*, and *transitive*, for each of these properties, respectively.

# Definition: homomorphism

A *homomorphism* is a structure-preserving map.

> todo: mathematical definition


Order is one kind of structure we might preserve.

# Ostinati & tessellation

A musical *ostinato* is a repeated musical pattern. 

- rhythmic ostinato
- melodic ostinato
- harmonic ostinato

A mathematical tessellation is a ... todo: definition of tessellation. 

We can compose by tessellating ostinati.

## abstract

As scientists, it's desirable to demonstrate to others (including our future selves) that our computational scientific work validates the claims we make in published research. Being able to reproduce the work is a key component of easily validating an analysis, as well as extending the work. Reproducibility is not as simple, however, as sharing the code and data that produced our analysis. We must consider how our data and algorithms are understood, variables defined, etc. Our code needs to be accessible and interoperable. There is much guidance about best practice, but this is often overwhelming for those of us who are not from formal computer science training. In this talk I share the story of how I attempted good enough practice in my doctoral thesis, and found even this was simply too much to achieve. Indeed, despite failing to achieve good enough scientific practice in any aspect of reproducibility, I discovered a delightful world of scientific workflows in R that make every day just that bit easier now. Failing at reproducible science in R is the best we can aim for; we will never achieve best practice in every aspect of reproducibility, and if we failed, then we tried. Through this process we discover useful tools to make the next time easier.   

## bio

Charles T. Gray is a postdoc with the evidence synthesis lab at Newcastle University in the UK. She is currently specialising in Bayesian network meta-analysis in Cochrane intervention reviews. She has three degrees: arts, music, and mathematics. None of these prepared her for writing a dissertation in interdisciplinary computational metascience doctoral thesis in R.

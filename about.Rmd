### heidelberg laureate forum 

It was a delight to participate in the opening of the [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/), where the laureates of mathematics and computer science meet the next generation. 

I've cued this video to my presentation on the algebra of composition.

There's no Nobel prize in mathematics and computer science. Instead, there is the Turing award, the Fields medal, and the Abel prize. Each year the Heidelberg Laureate Forum Foundation gathers these laureates of mathematics and computing, along with two hundred talented early-career researchers, and science writers, for a week of lectures, workshops, and events designed to foster conversation and ideas. 

It was a gift to present at the opening ceremony and have that introduction; I wasn't in want of conversation for the entire event. I got to meet so many interesting people. 

Slides for the presentation can be found [here](https://softloud.github.io/onetimetrophybitch/talks/hlf/hlf-2019-xaringan.html#1).

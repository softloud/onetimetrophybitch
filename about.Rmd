## heidelberg laureate forum 

It was a delight to participate in the opening of the [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/), where the laureates of mathematics and computer science meet the next generation. 

I've cued this video to my presentation on the algebra of composition.

There's no Nobel prize in mathematics and computer science. Instead, there is the Turing award, the Fields medal, and the Abel prize. 

Slides for the presentation can be found [here](https://softloud.github.io/onetimetrophybitch/talks/hlf/hlf-2019-xaringan.html#1).

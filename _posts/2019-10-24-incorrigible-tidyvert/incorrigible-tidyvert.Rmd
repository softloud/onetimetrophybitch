## incorrigible tidy::vert  `%>%  exegesis()`

> This post will be adapted for inclusion in a joint publication of mathematically-informed artworks engaging with Magritte's pipe, an icon of surrealism. This forthcoming publication is from a working group of researchers who met at the 2019 [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/).

In the painting, _The Treachery of Images_, Magritte's declares  _Ceci n'est pas une pipe_ (_This is not a pipe_). In so doing, he highlights this is but an _image_, a representation, of a pipe, not truly a pipe itself.

I recently wrote a song with lots of references to R and the `tidyverse::` metapackage. [@grolemund_r_2017]  

```
I didn't mean to %>% your bubble
I'm just an incorrigible tidy::vert
```

In this post, I'll unpack the statistical computing terminology used, and, in particular, the [_pipe_](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) operator, ` %>% `, that features throughout the lyrics. 


## the ` %>% ` operator in the R language

```{r fig.cap="[Image source: `magritrr::` GitHub repository.](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr/blob/master/man/figures/logo.png?raw=true)", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("pipe-logo.png")

```

The ` %>% ` pipe operator is the first major concept introduced in the programming section, following exploratory data analysis and data wrangling, of Wickham's _R for Data Science_ [@grolemund_r_2017]. The operator is provided in the `magrittr::` package.




## incorrigible tidy::vert  `%>%  lyrics()`

```
Caught the train to Leipzig, snow is falling
But I am not nearly done
Rube Goldberging this algorithm
But the sampling is off.

I didn't mean to %>% your bubble
I'm just an incorrible tidy::vert

And I'm here to tell ya
There's some rhyme and reason
But there's a whole lot that can get fucked up

And I'm here to tell ya
There's scarce rhyme and reason
So let's brace for the shitstorm

Don't think I'll unravel
The mysteries of the beta distribution
On the the train Leipzig with snow falling
And my %>%s are getting too long

But I didn't mean to %>% your bubble
I'm just an incorrible tidy::vert

And I'm here to tell ya
There's some rhyme and reason
But there's a whole lot that can get fucked up

And I'm here to tell ya
There's scarce rhyme and reason
So let's brace for the CRANstorm

And I didn't mean to %>% your bubble
Let your flame war flame itself out
And I didn't mean to %>% your bubble
Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?

And I didn't mean to %>% your bubble
I'm just an incorrible tidy::vert
And I didn't mean to %>% your bubble
I'm just an incorrible tidy::vert


```

Don't say I didn't warn you about the sound quality.

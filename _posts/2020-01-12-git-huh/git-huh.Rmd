# 1 this is not working as expected

I don't get it. 

I am trying to figure out how to do feature branch development, as I am starting to work on big sprawling pieces of software. 

`git branch` tells me `* master` and `variable-estimator` are branches on my local tree.

After `git checkout variable-estimator`, asking `git branch` again tells me `master` and `* variable-estimator` are branches on my local tree. So, `*` means current location on local tree.    

## 1.1 weird thing with the file

# 2 explain this to me using small words
